# Mobile Audio Fix for WebRTC Calls

## üéØ Problem
Audio works on web during WebRTC calls but doesn't work on mobile (Android). Users could see each other (video works) but couldn't hear each other on mobile devices.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by incorrect audio routing configuration on mobile devices:

1. **Speaker Mode Forced**: The code was starting with `forceSpeakerphoneOn: true`, which can cause audio routing confusion on some Android devices
2. **Missing Audio Focus**: Android requires proper audio focus management for call audio
3. **Wrong Initial Mode**: Starting in speaker mode instead of earpiece mode (natural call behavior)
4. **Volume Settings**: Audio volume wasn't being set optimally

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed WebRTC Service Audio Initialization
**File**: `/app/logistic-calling_webrtc/app/service/webrtc-service.tsx`

#### Changes Made:
- Changed initial audio mode from speaker to **earpiece** (line 620-632)
- Set `speaker: false` and `forceSpeakerphoneOn: false` for natural call experience
- Added explicit `InCallManager.setSpeakerphoneOn(false)` call
- Updated fallback AudioRouteModule to also start with earpiece

**Why this fixes it**:
- Earpiece is the natural and expected mode for phone calls
- Some Android devices have issues when forcing speaker mode initially
- This ensures proper audio routing channel selection

### 2. Enhanced AudioRouteModule (Android Native)
**File**: `/app/logistic-calling_webrtc/android/app/src/main/java/com/coinbase/AudioRouteModule.java`

#### New Features Added:
1. **Audio Focus Management**:
   - Request audio focus with `AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT`
   - Handle audio focus changes with listener
   - Properly abandon audio focus on cleanup

2. **Optimized Volume Settings**:
   - Set volume to 80% of max (not 100%) to avoid distortion
   - Added volume logging for debugging

3. **Improved Mode Setting**:
   - Start with `MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION` (proper for calls)
   - Start with earpiece (not speaker)
   - Proper cleanup on stop

**Why this fixes it**:
- Audio focus is required on Android for call audio to work properly
- `MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION` tells Android this is a voice call
- Proper volume prevents distortion and ensures clarity

### 3. Added Missing Android Permissions
**File**: `/app/logistic-calling_webrtc/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

#### New Permissions:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
```

**Why these are needed**:
- **BLUETOOTH**: For routing audio to Bluetooth devices if connected
- **BLUETOOTH_CONNECT**: Required for Android 12+ Bluetooth audio
- **WAKE_LOCK**: Keeps device awake during calls
- **FOREGROUND_SERVICE**: Allows InCallManager to run properly

## üì± How It Works Now

### Call Flow with Fixed Audio

1. **User A initiates call**:
   - Gets user media (microphone + camera)
   - Requests audio focus from Android system ‚úÖ
   - InCallManager starts with **earpiece mode** ‚úÖ
   - Audio session set to `MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION` ‚úÖ
   - Volume set to optimal level (80% of max) ‚úÖ
   - Creates peer connection
   - Sends offer to User B

2. **User B receives call**:
   - Gets user media (microphone + camera)
   - Requests audio focus from Android system ‚úÖ
   - InCallManager starts with **earpiece mode** ‚úÖ
   - Audio session set to `MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION` ‚úÖ
   - Creates peer connection
   - Sends answer to User A

3. **Connection established**:
   - Both users' audio tracks are exchanged
   - Audio plays through **earpiece** (natural call mode)
   - Users can **hear each other** on mobile! ‚úÖ

4. **During call**:
   - User can toggle to speaker if needed
   - Audio routing stays stable
   - Microphone and video can be toggled

5. **Call ends**:
   - InCallManager stops
   - Audio focus is abandoned ‚úÖ
   - Audio mode returns to `MODE_NORMAL` ‚úÖ
   - All tracks stopped

## üîä Audio Routing Modes

### Earpiece Mode (Default - NEW!)
- ‚úÖ Audio plays through earpiece (phone speaker near ear)
- ‚úÖ Natural call experience
- ‚úÖ More reliable on Android devices
- ‚úÖ Better audio quality and focus
- üì± User holds phone to ear (natural behavior)

### Speaker Mode (Can be toggled)
- üîä Audio plays through loudspeaker
- üëê Hands-free conversation
- üîò User can toggle via speaker button

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### 1. Rebuild the Android App
**IMPORTANT**: Native code changes require a full rebuild!

```bash
cd /app/logistic-calling_webrtc

# Clean previous builds
cd android && ./gradlew clean
cd ..

# Rebuild and run
npx react-native run-android
```

### 2. Test Call Functionality

#### Test 1: Basic Audio
1. Login with two users on two Android devices
2. Start a call from User A to User B
3. **Expected**: Both users should hear each other through earpiece
4. Speak into microphone - other user should hear clearly

#### Test 2: Speaker Toggle
1. During active call, tap speaker button
2. **Expected**: Audio switches to loudspeaker
3. Tap again to return to earpiece
4. Audio should remain clear throughout

#### Test 3: Long Call
1. Keep call active for 2-3 minutes
2. **Expected**: Audio remains stable, no dropouts
3. Audio focus should be maintained

### 3. Check Logs

Look for these log messages:

**Successful InCallManager Start**:
```
üéØ WebRTC: Using InCallManager for audio routing
‚úÖ WebRTC: InCallManager started successfully with earpiece mode
```

**Successful Audio Focus**:
```
AudioRouteModule: Audio focus granted
AudioRouteModule: Audio routing started with earpiece mode, volume set to [X]
```

**Audio Track Active**:
```
üìû WebRTC: Audio track is live and active - ready for WebRTC
```

   - Call end from both sides
   - Speaker toggle during call
   - Background/foreground transitions

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If audio still doesn't work:

1. **Check Permissions**: Ensure microphone permission is granted
2. **Check Logs**: Look for InCallManager and AudioRouteModule logs
3. **Test AudioManager**: Check if `AudioManager.MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION` is set
4. **Verify Rebuild**: Make sure you did a clean rebuild (not just refresh)
5. **Check Device**: Test on different Android devices (some have different audio handling)

### Common Issues:

**Issue**: Audio works sometimes but not always
- **Solution**: Ensure audio focus is being requested properly (check logs)

**Issue**: Audio is distorted or too loud
- **Solution**: Volume is now set to 80% - can adjust in `startAudioRouting()` method

**Issue**: Bluetooth headset not working
- **Solution**: Verify BLUETOOTH_CONNECT permission is granted (required for Android 12+)

## üìù Technical Notes

### Why Earpiece Instead of Speaker?

1. **Natural Behavior**: People expect calls to work through earpiece
2. **Audio Focus**: Android grants audio focus more reliably for earpiece mode
3. **Better Routing**: Earpiece mode has fewer routing conflicts
4. **Device Compatibility**: Works consistently across more Android devices
5. **Privacy**: Earpiece is more private (default for calls)

### Audio Focus Importance

Android's audio focus system ensures that only one app uses audio at a time. Without requesting audio focus:
- System may mute your audio
- Other apps can interrupt your call
- Audio routing may not work properly

### MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION vs MODE_NORMAL

- **MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION**: Optimized for voice calls
  - Better echo cancellation
  - Proper audio routing
  - Optimized for voice frequencies
  
- **MODE_NORMAL**: Regular media playback
  - Not optimized for calls
  - May cause routing issues

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The fix is successful if:
1. ‚úÖ Audio works on mobile through earpiece
2. ‚úÖ Users can hear each other clearly
3. ‚úÖ Speaker toggle works properly
4. ‚úÖ No audio dropouts during calls
5. ‚úÖ Web functionality remains unchanged
6. ‚úÖ Logs show proper InCallManager/AudioRouteModule initialization

**The mobile audio should now work perfectly! üéâ**
