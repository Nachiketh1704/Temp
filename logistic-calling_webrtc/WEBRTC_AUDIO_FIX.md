# WebRTC Audio Fix - Complete Solution

## 🎯 Problem
No audio during WebRTC calls between two users. Users could connect but couldn't hear each other.

## 🔧 Root Cause
The issue was caused by missing audio routing configuration. While WebRTC was creating peer connections and exchanging media tracks, the audio wasn't being routed properly to the device's earpiece/speaker.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Installed `react-native-incall-manager`
```bash
npm install react-native-incall-manager --save
```

**What it does:**
- Manages audio routing during calls (earpiece vs speaker)
- Handles proximity sensor
- Manages audio session on iOS
- Configures audio focus on Android

### 2. Updated `webrtc-service.tsx`

#### Added InCallManager Import
```typescript
// Import InCallManager for audio routing
let InCallManager: any;
let inCallManagerAvailable = false;

try {
  InCallManager = require('react-native-incall-manager');
  inCallManagerAvailable = true;
  console.log('✅ InCallManager loaded successfully');
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('⚠️ InCallManager not available:', error);
  inCallManagerAvailable = false;
}
```

#### Start InCallManager When Getting User Media
```typescript
// Start InCallManager for proper audio routing
if (inCallManagerAvailable) {
  console.log('📞 WebRTC: Starting InCallManager...');
  InCallManager.start({ media: type, auto: true, ringback: '' });
  InCallManager.setForceSpeakerphoneOn(false); // Use earpiece by default
  console.log('📞 WebRTC: ✅ InCallManager started');
}
```

#### Enhanced Remote Track Handling
```typescript
// Handle remote stream with detailed logging and audio track enabling
this.peerConnection.addEventListener('track', (event) => {
  console.log('📞 WebRTC: Received remote track:', {
    kind: event.track.kind,
    id: event.track.id,
    enabled: event.track.enabled,
    muted: event.track.muted,
    readyState: event.track.readyState
  });
  
  this.remoteStream = event.streams[0];
  
  // Enable all audio tracks in the remote stream
  if (this.remoteStream) {
    const audioTracks = this.remoteStream.getAudioTracks();
    
    audioTracks.forEach((track, index) => {
      track.enabled = true;
      console.log(`📞 WebRTC: Enabled remote audio track ${index}`);
    });
  }
  
  this.emit('remoteStream', this.remoteStream);
});
```

#### Stop InCallManager on Cleanup
```typescript
// Stop InCallManager
if (inCallManagerAvailable) {
  console.log('📞 WebRTC: Stopping InCallManager...');
  InCallManager.stop();
  console.log('📞 WebRTC: ✅ InCallManager stopped');
}
```

#### Added Speaker Toggle Method
```typescript
/**
 * Toggle speaker on/off
 */
toggleSpeaker(enabled: boolean): void {
  if (inCallManagerAvailable) {
    console.log('📞 WebRTC: Toggling speaker:', enabled);
    InCallManager.setForceSpeakerphoneOn(enabled);
    console.log('📞 WebRTC: ✅ Speaker toggled');
  }
}
```

### 3. Updated `callStore.ts`

#### Connected Speaker Toggle to WebRTC Service
```typescript
// Toggle speaker
toggleSpeaker: () => {
  const { isSpeakerEnabled } = get();
  const newSpeakerState = !isSpeakerEnabled;
  
  // Toggle speaker using webrtcService (InCallManager)
  if (webrtcService) {
    webrtcService.toggleSpeaker(newSpeakerState);
  }
  
  set({ isSpeakerEnabled: newSpeakerState });
  console.log('📞 CallStore: Speaker toggled, enabled:', newSpeakerState);
},
```

## 📱 How It Works Now

### Call Flow with Audio

1. **User A initiates call**:
   - Gets user media (microphone + camera)
   - InCallManager starts → routes audio to earpiece
   - Creates peer connection
   - Adds local audio/video tracks to connection
   - Sends offer to User B

2. **User B receives call**:
   - Gets user media (microphone + camera)
   - InCallManager starts → routes audio to earpiece
   - Creates peer connection
   - Adds local audio/video tracks to connection
   - Sends answer to User A

3. **Connection established**:
   - Both users' audio tracks are exchanged
   - Remote audio tracks are automatically enabled
   - InCallManager ensures audio plays through earpiece
   - Users can hear each other!

4. **During call**:
   - User can toggle speaker on/off
   - User can mute/unmute microphone
   - User can toggle video on/off

5. **Call ends**:
   - InCallManager stops
   - Audio routing returns to normal
   - All tracks are stopped
   - Peer connection is closed

## 🔊 Audio Routing

### Default (Earpiece Mode)
- Audio plays through earpiece (phone speaker near ear)
- Proximity sensor active
- Private conversation mode

### Speaker Mode
- Audio plays through loudspeaker
- Proximity sensor inactive
- Hands-free conversation mode

## 🧪 Testing

### After rebuilding the app:

1. **Start a call between two users**
2. **Check logs for InCallManager**:
   ```
   📞 WebRTC: Starting InCallManager...
   📞 WebRTC: ✅ InCallManager started
   ```

3. **Check for remote audio tracks**:
   ```
   📞 WebRTC: Received remote track: {kind: 'audio', ...}
   📞 WebRTC: Remote audio tracks: 1
   📞 WebRTC: Enabled remote audio track 0
   ```

4. **Test audio**:
   - Speak into User A's microphone
   - User B should hear the audio through earpiece
   - Toggle speaker on User B
   - User B should now hear through loudspeaker

5. **Test during call**:
   - Toggle mute → other user should not hear
   - Toggle speaker → audio should switch earpiece/speaker
   - End call → InCallManager should stop

## 🚀 Next Steps

**You need to rebuild the app for InCallManager to work:**

### For Android:
```bash
cd android && ./gradlew clean
cd .. && npm run android
```

### For iOS:
```bash
cd ios && pod install
cd .. && npm run ios
```
